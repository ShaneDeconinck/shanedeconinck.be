At [Howest Cyber3Lab](https://www.cyber3lab.be/), we're keeping a close eye on tokenization ‚Äî especially how it can move from innovation labs into real-world adoption for SMEs and consumers.

A **tokenized asset** is a real-world asset represented digitally on a blockchain, making it more **transferable, tradable, and programmable**. This includes stocks, bonds, real estate, or art. Yet, adoption has been slow due to **fragmentation and regulatory uncertainty**.

For too long, tokenized assets have either been:
- **Fully custodial**, managed by niche providers that are less familiar to most consumers, who may feel more inclined to hold assets with their trusted bank, or  
- **Designed for crypto enthusiasts**, limiting mainstream adoption.

That‚Äôs why **SWIFT stepping into digital asset securities** is a major signal.

With **11,000+ financial institutions across 200+ countries**, SWIFT is the backbone of financial messaging ‚Äî connecting banks, securities markets, and global payments infrastructure.  
By expanding into tokenized finance, they‚Äôre **bridging traditional finance and digital assets at scale**.

This isn‚Äôt their first significant move. Their **migration to ISO 20022**, an open financial messaging standard built for interoperability, was a major shift toward **global financial interoperability**. Now, they‚Äôre signaling interest in extending this infrastructure to **digital asset securities** ‚Äî a step that could standardize the interaction between **digital and traditional finance**.

Their latest report highlights **5 key opportunities** to bring tokenized finance to the mainstream:

- **Roles & Responsibilities** ‚Äì Clearer accountability for market participants.  
- **Token Standards** ‚Äì Standardizing interactions for broader adoption.  
- **The Cash Leg** ‚Äì Enabling digital cash settlements for tokenized assets.  
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability** ‚Äì Connecting blockchains across ecosystems.  
- **Reference Data** ‚Äì Universal identifiers to reduce fragmentation.

For those working to bridge blockchain and everyday businesses, **this could be the moment tokenization moves from novelty to mainstream**.  
SWIFT has **reach**, **trust**, and **infrastructure** ‚Äî but is that enough?

Because in the end, it‚Äôs not just about where and how custody is managed ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **what works best for users** and **how everything interconnects**.  
**Tokenization will only succeed if all custody models ‚Äî whether fully custodial, self-custody, or hybrid ‚Äî can interoperate seamlessly.**
