### 💭 Explanation

In centralized systems, architecture often begins with the happy path. Control is assumed — over users, infrastructure, and recovery. If something breaks, a patch, a rollback, or an update usually solves it behind the scenes.  

Blockchain doesn’t work that way.

A bug in a smart contract is public, irreversible, and expensive. Fixing it often requires social coordination, protocol upgrades, or governance votes — not just redeploying a build. You don’t control the clients. You don’t control the nodes. You might not even control the code once it’s live.

Where centralized systems can layer security onto functionality, **blockchain demands resilience at the core**.  
Every new feature increases **permanent attack surface**.

> In centralized IT, features expand utility.  
> In blockchain, they expand exposure.

This isn’t fear — it’s physics. Without a central authority to fall back on, the architecture itself must hold the line. Even in permissioned networks, where participants are known, trust and alignment can't be assumed.  

**Distributed ≠ dependable. Known ≠ safe.**

Blockchain architecture isn't about eliminating failure — it's about expecting it, and absorbing it without collapse.

### 🥷 How to Apply

- **Design from failure up.** Don’t assume the happy path — build for breakdowns.
- **Validate every input.** Not because it’s best practice — because bad input is permanent.
- **Model untrusted behavior.** Assume nodes go offline, lie, or act selfishly.
- **Avoid tight coupling.** One failure should never freeze the system.
- **Simulate adversaries, not just bugs.** Go beyond edge cases.
- **Keep it simple.** Complexity isn’t clever — it’s fragile.
- **Assume upgrades are political.** Technically possible ≠ socially feasible.

_Every Sunday, I’ll propose a blockchain first principle for architects. Not fixed rules, but emerging truths — meant to be ruthlessly challenged, like a scientific hypothesis. If a principle can’t stand up to questioning, I’ll refine or toss it._
