### 💭 Explanation
Ironically, when trust is low, **we shouldn't eliminate it** — we must bring in untrusted participants as a last resort and reward them well for it.  
Instead of relying on a single authority, we distribute validation across a network to prevent any single point of control — not by reducing trust to the most trusted entity, but by spreading it.

### Trust exists on a spectrum:
- **Full trust**: A centralized system where a single authority controls everything.  
- **No trust**: A fully permissionless blockchain where security comes from decentralized consensus.  
- **Middleground**: Permissioned or non-permissioned systems with tradeoffs act as a hybrid, balancing efficiency and decentralization — whether by selecting a limited set of trusted validators or by removing Proof of Work while maintaining security through alternative consensus mechanisms.

### Blockchain is defensive by design:
Prevention over correction. The system is built to stop bad transactions **before** they happen.

- **Verification, not enforcement** — once a transaction is recorded, it’s final. There’s no undo button.  
- **Decentralization has a price** — more verification leads to slower, costlier transactions.  
- **Incentives drive security** — trustless participants need strong incentives to secure the network.

### 🥷 How to Apply

- **If trust exists, use it.** Centralized systems are faster and more efficient. If trust is weak, don’t be naïve — blockchain is costly but necessary when enforcement cannot be delegated.  
- **Permissioned blockchains are a middle ground.** They allow selected validators to maintain efficiency while reducing reliance on a single authority.  
- **If privacy matters, expect complexity.** Trustless systems require additional cryptographic layers for privacy.  
- **Consensus is a tradeoff.** Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority optimize for different balances of trust, efficiency, and security.  
- **Hybrid models work.** Permissioned and permissionless networks can coexist, leveraging their respective strengths.

_Every Sunday, I’ll propose a blockchain first principle for architects. Not fixed rules, but emerging truths — meant to be ruthlessly challenged, like a scientific hypothesis. If a principle can’t stand up to questioning, I’ll refine or toss it._
