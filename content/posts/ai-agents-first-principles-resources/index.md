AI Agents can only be designed, built and applied well if the underlying components are understood to a sufficient level.

These are the resources that I found the most valuable so far for diving into those first principles, without getting "vendor-locked". I believe we learn the most when we share our knowledge, so I'm happy to share these with you.

## Books

- **[AI Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/)** by Chip Huyen — plus the [76 minutes speed-run video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD3A1n9J6Y0) by Marina Wyss

## Video Courses & Lectures

- **[Neural networks playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)** including how LLMs work, by Grant Sanderson (3blue1brown)

## Courses

And of course, the courses and sessions offered by my colleagues at HOWEST University of Applied Sciences.
