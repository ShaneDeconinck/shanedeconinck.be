# Shane Deconinck

**Web3 Lead | Decentralized Trust | Trusted AI Agents**

I grew the Web3 team at Howest Cyber3Lab from the ground up, leading applied research projects across blockchain, self-sovereign identity, and digital trust. Along the way, I earned recognition as a [2025 LF Decentralized Trust community awardee](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/2025-community-awards-recognizing-contributions-from-across-the-lf-decentralized-trust-community), spoke at Linux Foundation summits in Europe and Tokyo, and built communities that bridge academia, industry, and open source.

Now I'm looking for my next challenge: **bringing trusted AI agents to the enterprise**. I'm fascinated by how we ensure safety, accountability, and reliability when autonomous systems operate across organizational boundaries — and I want to build it.

I hold certifications in Hyperledger Fabric, Besu, Laravel, and Design Thinking. I write, speak, and demystify complex tech — helping businesses separate hype from real-world value.

**Open to opportunities** in AI agents, decentralized identity, and digital trust.
