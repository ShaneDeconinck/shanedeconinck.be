# Shane Deconinck

I’m recognized for my leadership and innovation in decentralized technologies, with deep expertise in digital trust and extensive experience as a senior full stack web developer. 

I hold certifications in Laravel, Design Thinking, Hyperledger Fabric, and Besu, blending technical mastery with a user-focused and strategic approach. 

Recently, I expanded my focus to Trusted AI Agents, exploring how to ensure their safety and reliability across diverse trust boundaries within digital systems.

At Howest Cyber3Lab, I lead applied research projects and actively contribute to the Linux Foundation Digital Trust (LFDT) community. I write, speak, and build communities dedicated to demystifying complex tech. Helping businesses separate hype from value and embrace real-world adoption.
